## A social networking site for musicians

<img src="https://msespos.github.io/portfolio/imgs/mytunes%20screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the myTunes app" width="500"/>

This web application is a social networking site geared towards musicians, for sharing news, thoughts, images, and audio related to their creative work.
Users can friend each other, make text, image, and audio posts, and like and comment on their friends' posts.

The app was built in Ruby on Rails and Postgres, styled with Tailwind, and tested with RSpec and Capybara.

To try it out, visit the following link:

Please allow a small wait time (typically less than 30 seconds) for Heroku's dyno to wake up.

For best results, create several user accounts. You can then request and confirm user friendships, and once those friendships have been created, you can share posts and likes and comments among your users.

You can also log in with Google if you'd prefer.
